# minishift-setup
This repository describes a minishift local setup using virtualbox and helm
for local development of application deployed to OpenShift.

## Warning

Testing is done on Debian Linux a there are no guarantees that it will work anywhere
else out of the box even when it should. Because we will use Virtualbox 
(open source version is enough) as virtualization abstraction layer,
 it should not play a role weather you install on linux, windows or mac. In theory...
